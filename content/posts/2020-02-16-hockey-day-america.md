Well...maybe not, but it is Hockey Day in America. What better day than to launch this new site hackinghockey.com?!

The idea started when I got into hockey about a year or so ago. I wanted to create a place where I could blog, as I was hacking through my first hockey clinics, learning the basics of skating, passing, and shooting. Like most ideas, it sat in the proverbial parking garage and almost never saw the light of day.

Eventually, as I started to dive into the world of #HockeyTwitter and hockey analytics, the name took on a new meaning as I started playing around with hockey data. I'm a software engineer by day and by night I couldn't stay away from this part of the game.

Hacking Hockey's goal is to combine both ideas, serving as a resource for newcomers to the game (as I grow my own knowledge), while also providing accessible and eventually more advanced hockey analysis. With the combination of learning the game and the learning how to analyze the game, I hope to provide resources for all levels of knowledge and interest. Everything will be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackinghockey).
